# SQLite
SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. It is a popular choice as an embedded database for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers. It is also used in many other applications that need a lightweight, embedded database.

SQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standards, using a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee domain integrity.
One of the main benefits of using SQLite is that it is very easy to get started with. To create a new database in SQLite, you simply need to create a new file on your filesystem and connect to it using the sqlite3 API.
