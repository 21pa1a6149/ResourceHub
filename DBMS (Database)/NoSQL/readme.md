# NoSQL

NoSQL is a type of database management system (DBMS) that is designed to handle and store large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables with pre-defined schemas to store data, NoSQL databases use flexible data models that can adapt to changes in data structures and are capable of scaling horizontally to handle growing amounts of data.

The term NoSQL originally referred to “non-SQL” or “non-relational” databases, but the term has since evolved to mean “not only SQL,” as NoSQL databases have expanded to include a wide range of different database architectures and data models.

This section is curated collection of NoSQL Resources.
