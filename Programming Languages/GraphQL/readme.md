# GraphQL
GraphQL is an open source server-side technology which was developed by Facebook to optimize RESTful API calls. It is an execution engine and a data query language. This tutorial will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of GraphQL including âˆ’
Implement GraphQL API using Apollo server, Test GraphQL API using GraphiQL and Build ReactJS (with Apollo Client library) and jQuery client applications to consume the API.

RESTful APIs follow clear and well-structured resource-oriented approach. However, when the data gets more complex, the routes get longer. Sometimes it is not possible to fetch data with a single request. This is where GraphQL comes handy. GraphQL structures data in the form of a graph with its powerful query syntax for traversing, retrieving, and modifying data.
