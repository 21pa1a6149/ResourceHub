# AngularJS

AngularJS is a powerful JavaScript framework developed and maintained by Google for building dynamic web applications. It extends HTML with additional attributes 
and directives, enabling the creation of interactive and responsive user interfaces.

AngularJS is well-suited for building single-page applications (SPAs) and dynamic web applications that require rich, interactive user interfaces. 
Its declarative syntax, modular architecture, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools make it a popular choice among developers for front-end development.

These resources are designed to help you learn AngularJS and leverage its features to build modern web applications. Whether you are new to AngularJS or looking 
to enhance your skills, the following sections cover tutorials, tools, best practices, and more to support your journey in AngularJS development.
