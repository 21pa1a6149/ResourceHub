# XML

XML stands for Extensible Markup Language and is a text-based markup language derived from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). Extensible Markup Language (XML) lets you define and store data in a shareable manner. XML supports information exchange between computer systems such as websites, databases, and third-party applications. Predefined rules make it easy to transmit data as XML files over any network because the recipient can use those rules to read the data accurately and efficiently.

These resources are designed for beginners and professionals.Each of these sections contain related topics with simple and useful resources.
