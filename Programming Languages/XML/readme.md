# XML

XML stands for Extensible Markup Language and is a text-based markup language derived from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). Extensible Markup Language (XML) lets you define and store data in a shareable manner. XML supports information exchange between computer systems such as websites, databases, and third-party applications. Predefined rules make it easy to transmit data as XML files over any network because the recipient can use those rules to read the data accurately and efficiently.
