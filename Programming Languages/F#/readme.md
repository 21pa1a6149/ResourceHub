# F#

F# (pronounced F sharp) is a general-purpose, high-level, strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming methods. It is most often used as a cross-platform Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) language on .NET, but can also generate JavaScript and graphics processing unit (GPU) code.
F# is a universal programming language for writing succinct, robust and performant code. 

F# allows you to write uncluttered, self-documenting code, where your focus remains on your problem domain, rather than the details of programming.

This section is curated collection which provides basic and advanced concepts of F# programming language.
